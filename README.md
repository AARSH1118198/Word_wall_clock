# Word_wall_clock
The provided code is a Python program that creates a Tkinter graphical user interface (GUI) application to display the current time in a word clock format. In a word clock, the time is represented using words in a grid-like arrangement, where each word corresponds to a specific unit of time.

The word clock layout is defined by the following grid:

```
   0123456789ABC
0 ITRISUHALFTEN
1 QUARTERTWENTY
2 FIVEQMINUTEST
3 PASTMTOSAMOPM
4 ONENTWOZTHREE
5 FOURFIVESEVEN
6 SIXEIGHTYNINE
7 TENELEVENPHIL
8 TWELVELOCLOCK
```

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionality of the code:

1. `import` statements: The code imports the necessary libraries, including `tkinter` for GUI creation and `time` for working with time-related operations.

2. `class SentenceClock(tk.Tk)`: This class represents the main GUI application. It inherits from `tk.Tk` and contains methods for initializing the application, updating the displayed time, and translating time values to the corresponding word clock positions.

3. `__init__(self)`: The constructor initializes the GUI window and sets up the word clock grid using labels. It also sets up a periodic call to the `update_time` method.

4. `update_time(self)`: This method updates the displayed time on the word clock. It calculates the current time, hour, minute, and AM/PM indicator, and then translates these values into word clock positions. The labels corresponding to the current time are highlighted to make them stand out.

5. `translate_to_or_past(self, minute)`: This method determines whether the word "PAST" or "TO" should be displayed based on the minute value.

6. `translate_minute(self, minute)`: This method translates the minute value into the corresponding word(s) for the word clock. It divides the time into blocks representing intervals such as "FIVE," "TEN," "A QUARTER," "TWENTY," "TWENTYFIVE," and "HALF."

7. `translate_hour(self, hour, minute)`: This method translates the hour and minute values into the corresponding word(s) for the word clock, considering whether it's past the half-hour mark.

8. `translate_time(self, hour, minute, am_or_pm)`: This method orchestrates the translation process for the entire time display. It combines the relevant words for the hour, minute, and AM/PM indicators, and returns a list of grid positions to highlight.

9. `if __name__ == "__main__":`: This conditional block creates an instance of the `SentenceClock` class and starts the Tkinter main loop to display and update the word clock GUI.

The code provides a visual representation of the current time using a word clock layout, where words are highlighted to indicate the current time. The graphical representation is updated every second to reflect the current time.
